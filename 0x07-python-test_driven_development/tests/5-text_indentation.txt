This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage
=====

Text is printed with two new lines after each of the characters ``.``, ``?``,
and ``:``.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hola!")
    Hola!
    <BLANKLINE>

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("   How are you?)
    How are you.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("          ")

Similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of each printed line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Hola.   ")
    Hola.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("    This is good.    You look pretty.   ")
    This is good.
    <BLANKLINE>
    You look pretty.
    <BLANKLINE>

The new lines are only printed for the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:`` -
text not ending with one of these characters is not ended with a new line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Correct words, good grammar")
    Correct words, good grammar

New lines within a string are printed as normal.

::

    >>> text_indentation("printing a new line! writen Here:\nPrinted.")
    Printing a new line! Writen here:
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    Printed.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("\n\n\n We just printed three new lines.")
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    We just printed three new lines.
    <BLANKLINE>

::
    >>> text_indentation("A sneaky \n new line.")
    A sneaky 
    new line.
    <BLANKLINE>
